A normalized approach to hiding the address bar on iOS and Android
=======================

## iOS 7.1+ and special `meta` tag

From [Amazing Web article](http://theamazingweb.net/2013/12/19/minimal-ui-viewport-meta-tag/)

> With iOS 7.1 beta 2 Apple added a new viewport meta tag that allows us to minimize the top and bottom bars in Safari on the iPhone. Itâ€™ll be basically the same behaviour as if the user starts to scroll. In the past we had to do this with a little trick and trigger the behaviour with a 1px scroll when the page was loaded.

Add this to the top of the page in `head`

```
<meta name="viewport" content="minimal-ui">
```
